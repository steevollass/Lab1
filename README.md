# Lab1


When testing our f1 score after training we got the specified results. But from some reason after saving and loading the model the model the results changed. we were not able to fix this in time.

In order to achieve these results, it is possible to run the train_models file, when specifing the path to the data. It takes a few minutes to train the  model.
We are sorry we were not able to properly finish the project in time.
